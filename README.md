# Automofix

* Download Git Bash - https://git-scm.com/downloads
* Create a 'repositories' folder somewhere
* Open Git Bash (command line, not GUI)
* Use linux commands to navigate (cd for change directory, ls for list, etc)
* Configure your git:
* git config --global user.name "John Doe"
* git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
* cd into repositories folder
* git clone https://github.com/hockeyadc/Automofix.git

# Pull/Push from Repositories

* Do whatever the fuck you have been doing because frankly you are at some point going to mess up a commit and I'd rather be giving the chance to review your changes before they get merged to the master branch

# Setting up your machine to handle what I added

* Pull down my latest updates, see shit above to do that
* Go here and follow instructions: http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows
* Open up git bash and go to the project folder and type in: npm install -g bower
* Go here to install Sass: http://sass-lang.com/documentation/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#using_sass
* Actually pay attention to the SASS shit, you will need to run: sass --watch sass:stylesheets and leave it running if you plan to do anything with the CSS
